# Football-Manager-Tkinter

🌟 **Started**: December 2024  
🚀 **Developed**: In development

This project is an extension of my previous project, **Football League Simulator**, and brings a more immersive experience to football management. It combines strategy, team management, and in-depth statistics to create an engaging simulation for users.  

## 🎯 Current Features  
- 🧑‍💼 **Manager Creation**: Create a manager profile and select a team to manage.  
- 📋 **Team Tactics**: Design and implement tactics to optimize team performance during games.
- ⚡ **Real-Time Decisions**: Make tactical decisions during matches, such as substitutions, formations, and shouts, that dynamically influence game outcomes. These decisions are reflected in match results, player performance, and overall team success.    
- 📊 **Comprehensive Statistics**: View detailed stats for individual players, your team, and the league you participate in.  

## 🚀 Planned Features  
- ⚽ **Multiple Divisions**: Introduce multiple divisions within the league for promotion and relegation.  
- 🌍 **Different Leagues**: Expand the game to include various leagues, each with its divisions.  
- 💰 **Player Contracts and Transfers**: Implement a transfer system and player contracts to enhance team-building strategies.  
- 🔄 **Manager Career Progression**: Enable managers to switch teams during their careers.
- 🧮 **Enhance algorithm**: Update the match outcome algorithm to take player form, morale, and tactics into account.

## 🛠️ Technical Details  
- **Built with Tkinter**:  
  - The graphical user interface is powered by Tkinter, providing a responsive and user-friendly experience.  

- **SQL Database for Data Management**:  
  - Player, team, match, and league data are stored in an SQL database, ensuring efficient querying, scalability, and data integrity.  
  - The use of SQL allows for complex data relationships and quick retrieval of league and team statistics.  

- **Match Outcome Algorithm**:  
  - The match outcome algorithm is based on the same system used in the **Football League Simulator**, where match results are influenced by team levels.
  - The database is updated in real-time with match results, player performance, and league standings.
  - In the future, player contributions will be decided based on the player's form, fitness, and morale rather than chance. Players will have defined attributes/levels that determine the overall force of a team in each position (defenders, midfielders and forwards) rather than the team having an overall level, which will serve as the basis on determining match outcome, goals scored and conceded
