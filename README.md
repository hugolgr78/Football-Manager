# Football-Manager-Tkinter

This is a project I've been working on since December 2024 and it is an extension to my previous project, Football League Simulator
The application currently allows users to:
- Create a manager and select a team they wish to manage
- Create tactics and manage their team during a game to maximise the outcome
- Look through statistics of their players, team and the league they participate in

Features that will be implemented in the future include:
- Multiple divisions for the league
- Different leagues each with their own divisions
- Player contracts and transfers
- Changing teams as a manager
